## Running the App Locally

This project uses environment variables to manage API keys securely.

Create a `.env` file inside the `app/` directory with the following content:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

The `.env` file is intentionally excluded from version control.

Then run:
```bash
cd app
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
