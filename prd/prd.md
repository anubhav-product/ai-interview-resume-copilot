## 2. Problem Statement

### Recruiter Problems
Recruiters, especially in startups and high-growth teams, receive a high volume of resumes for each role. Manual screening is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to bias, often resulting in missed qualified candidates and delayed hiring decisions.

Current tools rely heavily on keyword matching or rigid filters, which fail to capture true candidate fit and transferable skills.

### Candidate Problems
Candidates frequently receive rejections without structured or actionable feedback. This makes it difficult for them to understand skill gaps, improve interview performance, or prepare effectively for future roles.

Existing interview preparation platforms provide generic content rather than role-specific, personalized guidance.
